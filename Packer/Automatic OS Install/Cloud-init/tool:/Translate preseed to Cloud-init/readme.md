>#Translate a preseed file
>If you have a preseed file already, the [autoinstall-generator snap](https://snapcraft.io/autoinstall-generator) can help translate that preseed data to an autoinstall file. See this discussion on the [autoinstall generator tool](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/autoinstall-generator-tool-to-help-with-creation-of-autoinstall-files-based-on-preseed/21334) for more details on how to set this up.
