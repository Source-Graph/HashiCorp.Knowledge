>Most of what I've read, and tried to use to get an understanding of how cloud-init works, is from a different perspective (at least for me) than the Canonical Doc's... I think the more complete Doc's are from Amazon EC2 AWS::CloudFormation::Init, the Microsoft Azure (cloud-init support for virtual machines), and RedHat Atomic Host (setup for cloud-init) documentation. There they are explaining this is how you do it, to their customers. I think that a lot of Azure's understanding, came from Canonical... But Canonical's own Doc's on it seem very sparse. If they are there, they just are not as visual or accessible to find.
